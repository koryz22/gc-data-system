# Gausscode Data System

A ReactJS, HTML, and CSS project created under the guidance of Jeff and Wei!

## Getting started

1. Run "npm install" to install all the necessary modules used in the project.
2. Type "npx nodemon app.jsx" to compile and run the project.
3. Open "localhost:3000" to view website.

## A useful but challenging lesson

The "Gausscode Data System" project was not an easy journey. Along the road, I encountered many challenges such as: 

1. Passing data between web frames/pages
2. Nesting components together
3. Efficient coding and keeping an organized workspace
4. Using React props and hooks

These were only a few of the obstacles I had to overcome. But, powering through this project helped me learn a lot about general web development, ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. I was also able to become more comfortable with reading documentations, tracking progress with git, study standard React practices (ex: constructing specific components), page routing, and how to use hooks to create a responsive webpage for the first time.
